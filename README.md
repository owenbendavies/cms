# CMS

[![CI](https://github.com/owenbendavies/cms/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/owenbendavies/cms/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A CMS written in ReactJS, Ruby on Rails and Terraform used for learning.
Although it is a working project, it was not created with the intention of being
a production system. Instead this has been my practice project over the years,
used for testing new ideas.

## Development

1. `./bin/setup` to set up the system
1. `./bin/test` to run all tests
1. `./bin/test spec/models/user_spec.rb` to run one test or folder
1. `./bin/quality` to run code quality checks
1. `./bin/run` to start services
1. http://localhost:3000/ to access the site
1. http://localhost:3000/graphiql to view GraphQL api
